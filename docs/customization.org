* Faces

- ~helix-fake-cursor-extend-selection~ ::
  The face used for fake cursors when extending selection is active.

- ~helix-lazy-highlight~ ::
  Face for highlighting matches in interactive search with =/=, =?=, =*=, =M-*=, =n=, =N=.

* Variables

- ~helix-use-pcre-regex~ ::
  If non-nil use PCRE regexp syntax instead of Emacs one.

- ~helix-regex-history-max~ ::
  Maximum length of regexp search ring before oldest elements are thrown away.
  This ring is uesd with =/=, =?=, =*=, =M-*=, =n=, =N= commands.

- ~helix-max-cursors-number~ ::
  If your Emacs slows down or freezes when using too many cursors, customize
  this value appropriately. Cursors will be added until this value is reached,
  at which point you can either temporarily override the value or abort the
  operation entirely. Default is ~nil~ â€” no ceiling.

- ~helix-minor-modes-incompatible-with-multiple-cursors~ ::

  temporarily disabled when there are more then one cursor in the buffer.

- ~helix-keep-search-highlight-commands~ ::
  List of commands which should preserve search hints.

- ~helix-surround-alist~ ::
  Allows to customize patterns used for surrounding with =ms=, =md= and =mc= commands.
  See built-in documentation with =C-h v helix-surround-alist=.
