;;; Commentary:

;; The core functionality for multiple cursors. This module is heavily inspired
;; by `multiple-cursors.el' package from Magnar Sveen.
;;
;; Command is first executed for real cursor by Emacs command loop and then in
;; `post-command-hook' it executed by all fake cursors. Fake cursor is an
;; overlay that emulates cursor and stores inside point, mark, kill-ring and
;; some other variables (full list is in `helix-fake-cursor-specific-vars').
;; Executing command for fake cursor looks as follows: set point and mark to
;; positions saved in fake cursor overlay, restore all variables from it,
;; execute command in this environment, store point, mark and new state into
;; fake cursor overlay.
;;
;; ID 0 is always coresponding to real cursor.
