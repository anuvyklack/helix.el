KEY       - To what KEY this pattern should be binded?
INSERT    - Cons cell (LEFT . RIGHT) with strings, or function that returns such
            cons cell. The strigs that will be inserted by `helix-surround' and
            `helix-surround-change' functions.
SEARCH    - Any of:
            1. Cons cell with strings (LEFT . RIGHT). Should be patterns that
               will be used to search of two substrings to delete in
               `helix-surround-delete' and `helix-surround-change'functions.
               If not specified INSERT pair will be used.
            2. Function that return cons cell with strings (LEFT . RIGHT) like
               in 1.
            3. Function that returns list
                        (LEFT-START LEFT-END RIGHT-START RIGHT-END)
               with 4 positions of START/END of LEFT and RIGHT delimeters.
               Example:
                          left             right
                        |<tag> |Some text| </tag>|
                        ^      ^         ^       ^
                        ls     le        rs      re

Following parameters are taken into account only when SEARCH argument is a cons
cell with stirngs (LEFT . RIGHT) or a function, that returns such cons cell. If
SEARCH is a function that returns list with 4 positions, they will be ignored.

REGEXP?   - If non-nil then strings specified in SEARCH argument will be treated
            as regexp patterns, otherwise they will searched literally.
BALANCED? - When non-nil all nested balanced LEFT RIGHT pairs will be skipped,
            else the first found pattern will be accepted.

This function populates the buffer local `helix-surround-alist' variable,
and thus should be called from major-modes hooks.
See the defaul value of `helix-surround-alist' variable for examples."
